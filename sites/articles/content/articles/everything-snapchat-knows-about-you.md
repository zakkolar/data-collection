Most people use Snapchat because they like the way messages are instantly deleted. This makes it feels more private and secure than using regular text messages on your phone. But it's actually not very anonymous at all.

Here's a list of data Snapchat collects about its users:

- **Your contact list**: Snapchat collects your contacts from your phone so that you can more easily add people you know. They also use this to find people's names.
- **Your name**: When you sign up for Snapchat, they just ask for a username and not your real name. But, someone has your phone number in their contacts and shares that with Snapchat, Snapchat will know your name even though you never gave it to them.
- **Your location**: In order to use features like certain filters and the Snapmap, you need to share your location. Snapchat can use this to keep track of everywhere you go and make guesses about you such as the place you live, where you go to school, and when you take trips.
- **The websites you visit**: Snapchat uses technology called *cookies* to identify you when you browse websites. If this cookie is loaded by a website, Snapchat will know you were there.
- **Your phone number and email address**
- **Everything about the Snaps you send**, including:
  - Time, date, sender, recipient of message
  - Number of messages sent
  - Which friends you talk to the most
  - Interactions with messages (when you open, if you screenshot, etc)
- **The type of phone you use** and the unique code that identifies it

Some of this information is kept even after you delete your account.
