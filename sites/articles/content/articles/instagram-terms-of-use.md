Instagram recently released updated Terms of Use, which lists the terms you agree to in order to use the app.

## What's not new:

- **They record and track your personal info:** Facebook (which owns Instagram) collects a lot of information about you, including:
  - Things you post, look at, and comment on
  - Credit card information
  - Direct messages
  - Your face (for facial recognition)
  - Data from other companies that have shared information with Facebook and Instagram
- **They use and share your personal info**: Since you don't need to pay for Instagram, they need to make money by using your personal data to target ads from sponsors towards you.


## What's new:

- When you ask Instagram to delete any of your data, it may take up to 90 days before it is actually deleted.
- Even if you request information to be deleted, some of it may stay on Instagram's servers anyway.
