TikTok has been criticized for the amount of data it collects from its users. In 2020, the app was almost banned in the United States partially because of this.

While the app is still available now, here are five things that TikTok collects about its users.

## Everything you write, even if you don't send it.

According to Tik Tok's privacy policy, it collects all the "information you provide in the context of composing, sending, or receiving messages". This means it saves everything that you write, even if you delete it instead of sending it.

## Everything you touch on the screen

**Keystroke dynamics** is a way to identify people based on how they use a device. Every person types on their keyboards and swipes on their screen in a different way. If this data is collected, it can be used to identify a person based on their unique movements.

In TikTok's privacy policy, they acknowledge that some of the data the collect includes "keystroke patterns or rhythms".

## Everything about the device you use to access TikTok

TikTok captures the following information about the device you're using:

- IP Address (used to figure out your location)
- Model of the device (e.g. Nexus 5, iPod Touch 7)
- Mobile carrier
- Time zone
- Screen resolution
- Operating System (e.g. iOS, Android)
- Apps installed on the device
